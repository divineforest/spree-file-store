File Store
==========

A simple [Spree][1] extension that places a tab in the Administration section allowing users to upload files and manage uploaded files.  Uploaded files are placed within the public directory and are therefore readable by users of the application.

Upgraded to use Paperclip for file attachments, and to run on Spree 0.30 and Rails 3.

TODO Write documentation, and rake task for installing db migration
